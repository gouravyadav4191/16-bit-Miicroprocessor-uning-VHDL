# 16-bit-Miicroprocessor-uning-VHDL
This project focuses on the design and simulation of a simplified 16-bit processor using VHDL. it consists of fundamental blocks such as Program Counter, Register File, ALU, Control Unit, and Status Flags. Each module is individually designed, tested using dedicated testbenches, and finally integrated into a top-level CPU design
